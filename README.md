# Multi-Tier Web Application Deployment

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **multi-tier web application** using various cloud services and technologies to ensure scalability, availability, and maintainability.

## Project Overview

In this project, a multi-tier architecture is implemented, consisting of:

- **Frontend Layer**: A user interface (UI) that communicates with the backend.
- **Backend Layer**: A RESTful API that processes requests and interacts with the database.
- **Database Layer**: A relational database that stores and manages application data.

The application follows best practices for deployment and integrates services like **load balancing**, **auto-scaling**, **security**, and **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vanilla JS)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (or any other suitable backend technology)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL (can be replaced with other databases as per the use case)
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, or Google Cloud Platform
- **Load Balancer**: AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- **Auto-Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline (or other CI/CD tools)
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional, for containerizing the app)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation (for provisioning resources)

## Features

- **Multi-tier architecture**: The project separates the frontend, backend, and database for scalability and isolation.
- **High Availability**: Utilizes load balancing to distribute traffic and auto-scaling to handle varying traffic loads.
- **Security**: Implements secure communication (HTTPS), access control, and proper network isolation.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates deployment and testing of the application using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with cloud-native monitoring tools (like AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, or Prometheus) for logging and metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
- Docker (if using containerization).
- Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code.
- GitHub repository to store the source code and configuration files.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-tier-web-app.git
cd multi-tier-web-app
