# Multi-Tier Web Application Deployment

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **multi-tier web application** designed to provide scalability, availability, and maintainability. The architecture includes separate layers for the frontend, backend, and database, each deployed on cloud infrastructure to showcase best practices in cloud computing.

## Project Overview

In this project, a multi-tier architecture is implemented, consisting of:

- **Frontend Layer**: A user interface that communicates with the backend API.
- **Backend Layer**: A RESTful API handling user requests, business logic, and communication with the database.
- **Database Layer**: A relational database storing user and application data.

The aim of this project is to learn and implement best practices in cloud deployment, security, and scalability, using cloud services and technologies for real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vanilla JS)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (or other backend frameworks)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL (relational database)
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Load Balancer**: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- **Auto-Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform for provisioning cloud resources

## Features

- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: The application is split into frontend, backend, and database layers, with each component deployed independently.
- **High Availability & Scalability**: Load balancing and auto-scaling ensure that the application can handle varying amounts of traffic.
- **Security**: The project ensures secure connections through HTTPS and access control across different layers.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automatically build, test, and deploy the application via GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application health and performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting:

- An AWS account to deploy resources.
- Docker (if you're containerizing the application).
- Terraform for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
- Basic knowledge of multi-tier architecture and cloud deployments.
